  <h2>Welcome to PR-View</h2>
  <p>
    PR-View (/preview/) is a Pull Request activity visualizer.
  </p>
  <p>
    While you can use the activity feeds in sites like <a href="https://gitlab.com">GitLab</a>
    or <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> to see what is going on in a repo
    or organization I found that when it came to performing code reviews and
    following up on said reviews that a fleeting feed resulted in delays or
    missed responses.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example say you reviewed a PR and posted a bunch or comments.
    The author of the PR may not notice that you submitted a review if they are
    busy with other work. Sure they get an email but if they are like me I get
    a billion emails and they are all filtered and mostly ignored (My team
    mostly communicates over Slack so emails are just corporate stuff which can
    wait). I have to leave the PR open in different tabs and continually return
    to them to see if a review or a response to my review has been submitted.
  </p>
  <p>
    I tried RSS readers which gave toast notices but those were again fleeting
    (disappeared before I could look at them) and low on details; with a finite
    amount of space on a toast less is more. The feeds I was getting chose to
    not show the PR title but instead showed the PR number but those I don't
    memorize so again it was only so effective. It did however offer a read
    visualization to let me know which activities I've already read and which
    are new.
  </p>
  <p>
    PR-View is an attempt to build a radiator for all open PRs showing which
    PRs have comments and which were updated since last you read them. It will
    allow you to mark PRs as done to remove them from the radiator. The goal is
    to provide a single page view of what PRs are pending your attention.
